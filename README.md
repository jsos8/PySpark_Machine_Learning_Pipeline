# PySpark_CAS_ML
 This repository contains demo notebooks that illustrate differences in machine learning model development using PySPark and CAS. 
 Inside of the notebooks folder users will find the notebooks showing the machine learning pipeline with CAS and PySPark. The data dictionary markdown cells contain a link to a SAS page where the necessary csv can be downloaded.

 The current notebooks that can be found in the notebook directory are the following:

* cas_ml_pipeline.ipynb
* pyspark_ml_pipeline.ipynb

 The notebook folder will be updated as the series of <a>blogs comparing PySPark and CAS</a> are released.
